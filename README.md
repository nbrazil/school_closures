School attendance boundary data from the study:

Brazil, N., & Candipan, J. (2022). The neighborhood ethnoracial and socioeconomic context of public elementary school closures in US metropolitan areas. Social Science Research, 103, 102655.

We collected data on elementary school status and location from the National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD). To capture which regular elementary schools enrolling 4th-grade students were open and operational in 2010 (2009-10 school year), we used a combination of NCES′ internal school status indicator, open and closed dates, and enrollment data to determine a school's open status between 2010 and 2016 (2010–2011 and 2015–2016 school years, respectively).
